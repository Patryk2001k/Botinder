# Botinder https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3776AB?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=white
Botinder is simple app where you can join people with robots.

This is my project to cv. Goal of this project is to create simple app where user can log in, send his profile picture and see robots. 
App must be:
- funny and simmilar to tinder (thats why name Botinder :) )
- connect people with robots (like match on tinder)
- people and robots can send messages with each other

To this project i used frameworks and technologies like:
- sqlalchemy (to store information in database)
- flask (simple python web framework)
- flask_login (and everything with login_authentication)
- flask_uploads
- os library to create folders for current users and store images
- Bcrypt to hash password
- of course i use basic stuff like HTML, CSS, JS and jinja2, boostrap 
- alpine.js (i used this js framework to simple stuff with html, in shortcut this framework can do dynamic html in simple way and i think it is good for small projects)
