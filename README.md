## How to Register

To register, simply fill in the blank fields. However, there are two important points to keep in mind:

- **Domicile Setting**: Your domicile must be set to "Krak√≥w". Alternatively, if you are in Cracow, you need to grant the site permission to use your location. This is necessary because if the site detects that you are in a location with no available robot matches, like Berlin, it will start generating robots. This can be a time-consuming process, especially since the app is hosted on a slower, free server.

- **Account Information**: Ensure that your chosen username and login fields are different from each other.

## Example Account

If you don't want to register and would like to try the app, here is a test account:
- **Login:** Example
- **Password:** 444

## Site is slow and something cant load?
Please be aware that my site is hosted on a **free hosting service** on [render](https://render.com/), and as such, **resources are limited**. I ask for your **patience** if the site responds more slowly than expected. If you encounter an issue where content, such as potential new matches, does not load promptly after a short wait, a page refresh may resolve the issue.
